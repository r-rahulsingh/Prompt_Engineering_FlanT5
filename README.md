In this Project, I have worked on basically 3 tasks retrieving accurate data as possible using different Prompt Engineering techniques. 

1. HuggingFace : Related to Medical Informational ChatBot, by which from a medical conversation or any topic you can quickly retrieve information and quickly identify crucial information, reducing the time spent on manually reviewing interactions. Data Source : https://huggingface.co/datasets/ShenRuililin/MedicalQnA
2. Manual typed Conversation between 2 users : Self Conversation Chat Information Retrieval, where from a conversation on any topic, one can gather information and provide strategic decisions.
3. HuggingFace : Conversation Information Retriever : Leveraging insights from customer interactions allows for the creation of customized responses and personalized experiences. This personalised approach not only enhances engagement but also significantly boosts customer satisfaction. Data Source : https://huggingface.co/datasets/knkarthick/dialogsum
